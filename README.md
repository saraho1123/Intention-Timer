## Project Overview
We were tasked with building a timer that can log the type, goal, and length of the activity. Each activity type is associated with a specific color which is applied in several places throughout the site. The timer feature shows the countdown before displaying a congratulatory message and the option to log your activity, which is the only way to return back to the main page where you can create a new activity, aside from refreshing the page. The log activity feature allows the user to store the completed activities and display them under the Past Activities section, with the color flag of the type of activity that was chosen. Local Storage was used to preserve the information when the page is refreshed.

## Goals
Our goals were to improve upon refactoring, local storage, and separating our data model from the DOM. Our other goals were to enjoy working together and after the project, to want to work together again.

## Technologies
Our Intention Timer was built entirely from scratch using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, chrome dev tools.

## Challenges
Making our code SRP and DRY is something we could still improve upon.

## Wins
We enjoyed building it and working together. We used the timer to actually dictate our breaks while working through the project. We made our code more dynamic, as well as spending plenty of time refactoring.
